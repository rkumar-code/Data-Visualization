# Data-Visualization
A survey was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely:

Big Data (Spark / Hadoop)
Data Analysis / Statistics
Data Journalism
Data Visualization
Deep Learning
Machine Learning
The participants had three options for each topic: Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested. 2,233 respondents completed the survey.

The survey results have been saved in a csv file and can be accessed through this link: Topic_Survey_Assignment

If you examine the csv file, you will find that the first column represents the data science topics and the first row represents the choices for each topic.
